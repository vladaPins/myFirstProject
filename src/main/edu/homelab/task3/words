New Year‚Äôs Day is one of the biggest and most popular holidays in Russia. Like in most other countries, New Year‚Äôs Day falls on the 1st of January here, but the celebration begins on New Year‚Äôs Eve, on the 31st of December. Most people start celebrating it in the evening and finish early in the morning. The most important part is the moment when the New Year begins ‚Äì at midnight.

In Russia, New Year‚Äôs is a bigger holiday than Christmas, and it is very similar to Christmas in Western cultures. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates Christmas on the 7th of January, but, unlike Christmas in Western countries, it is a strictly religious holiday. In other words, usually, people do not have parties and family dinners on Christmas. We also do not have traditions of giving presents, putting up a Christmas tree and decorating in the Christmas period. We do all that for New Year‚Äôs.

In December, people shop for presents and Christmas trees (we call them ‚ÄúNew Year trees‚Äù). It is customary to give presents on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Most families make a lot of dishes and invite guests over. The guests might bring gifts, especially if there are little children there, but it is not necessary. Usually, people in Russia give presents to their family and friends. As for gifts for children, these are brought by Grandfather Frost ‚Äì the Russian version of Santa Claus.

On the 1st of January, at night, Grandfather Frost magically visits every family and leaves presents for children. There are no traditions with stockings here; he leaves the gifts under the New Year tree. Kids wake up in the morning and rush to see what is under the tree. This is the most exciting morning for them!

But let‚Äôs get back to New Year‚Äôs Eve. Usually, people start celebrating at about 9 p.m. or even later, it depends on the family‚Äôs own traditions. The celebration is basically a dinner party with a lot of dishes and drinks. People drink, eat, chat, sing, and have fun. Probably, the most traditional New Year dish is Olivier salad, made of sausages, diced boiled potatoes, vegetables and mayonnaise. In some countries, it is known as Russian salad.

Children usually eat something tasty, drink some fruit juice or soda and go to play in another room or outdoors. If there are little kids, their parents might invite Grandfather Frost to put on a little show for them, and give the children some presents. By the way, Russian Santa Claus does not work alone; he has a young assistant called Snegurochka. She is his granddaughter, and her name means something like ¬´Snow Girl¬ª.

A few minutes before midnight, people pour some champagne, turn on their TVs and watch the New Year Presidential Message. After that, the TV shows the Kremlin Clock. The Kremlin Clock is the most well-known and important clock in the country, similar to Big Ben in England. At 12 o‚Äôclock sharp it chimes, and that marks the beginning of the New Year. Millions of people say, ‚ÄúHappy New Year!‚Äù, cheer, drink champagne and pull crackers.

Most of the celebration takes place during the night. On the 1st of January, most people wake up late and clean up after the celebration. Usually, there is still a lot of food left over. Every year, there is a long holiday period from the 1st to the 9th or 10th of January. Most people do not work on those days; they just rest and watch New Year TV shows and movies. After that period, everything goes back to normal. Grown-ups go to work and children go to school.
Humanity has a lot of problems. Most of them are local and do not affect the global community but there are a few global issues. A global issue is an issue that affects every country in the world. People can clearly define them, however they are still not solved. One of the greatest challenges of our time is solving global problems.

The United Nations is the organization that defines these problems and takes measures to solve them. The United Nations is an example of cooperation of the world-leading countries. They want to make our world a better place.

So, what global issues do they solve? First, it is global warming. Our industrial activity causes a rise in the average temperature. It means that an average summer or winter day nowadays is warmer than it was a hundred years ago. Global warming is dangerous because it can cause ice melting. If glaciers melt, the sea level will rise, and most coastal cities and islands will be drowned.

Second, it is human impact on the environment. In some cities air pollution reached the point where it is dangerous for human health. Our plants, factories, cars produce a lot of CO2 and various pollutants.

Third, overpopulation. The population of our planet is 7.8 billion now, which is almost 8 times as much as it was two hundred years ago. It will keep growing, and the planet might just not be able to sustain that many inhabitants in the future. Overpopulation causes multiple problems including poverty. Did you know that 42 percent of people from Sub-Saharan Africa still live below the poverty line? The international poverty line is 1.9 dollars per day. People cannot fulfill their basic needs such as food, water and clothing.

These are the most discussed global problems nowadays. Their list might increase but all the problems are being worked on. Some countries decided to switch to alternative energy sources in the nearest future. Most countries at least recognize the problems.

In conclusion, I would like to say that not only the governments are responsible for our planet, but every single human as well. If we want to make the world a better place, we should realize that even small actions affect it.

Global warming is something we cannot ignore. It is reported that in the last 5 years the average temperatures on Earth have increased. Let‚Äôs discuss how we can stop it and make our planet better.

But first, let‚Äôs figure out what causes global warming. Climate change is caused by different reasons. There are many factories and power plants that create a lot of heat. That heat increases the overall temperature on Earth. The growing consumption of electricity also worsens the problem. The more we consume, the more heat is coming to the atmosphere, and the warmer it becomes.

But why exactly global warming is a threat? The most dangerous part of the problem is the fact that the heat can reach the North and South Poles. If it happens, thousands of icebergs will start to melt. In the end, the overall water level will increase. Many coastal cities and islands will end up drowned. But there is still hope for mankind.

Global warming can be prevented if we all work together. We should use green energy, the kind of energy that comes from the sources that cause little or no impact on the environment. There are such green energy sources as solar panels, wind power stations and hydroelectric power plants. Some countries already decided to switch completely to alternative power sources by 2040. In conclusion, I would like to say that we are facing this problem for the first time. If we do the right things, we can make our world a better place.
Elephants are amazing and big animals that live in various parts of the world. They are known for their large size, long trunks, and big ears. Elephants come in two main types: Asian elephants and African elephants.

Elephants have a special feature called a trunk, which is like a long nose. They use it to grab things, drink water, and even spray themselves to stay cool. Their big ears help them stay cool too, like fans. Elephants have strong legs and can walk for long distances.

These gentle giants usually live in groups called herds. The herds include adult elephants and their babies, called calves. Elephants eat plants, they are herbivores, and they munch on leaves, grass, and other plants.

One very special thing about elephants is their strong family bonds. They take care of each other and communicate with trumpet-like sounds. Elephants also have amazing memory; they can remember places and friends for a long time.

In summary, elephants are large animals with trunks and big ears. They have two types: Asian and African. Elephants live in herds and eat plants. They care for their family, talk with special sounds, and have great memories.

Air pollution and marine pollution are the most discussed ones. They are caused by different reasons. First of all, it is CO2 emitted by cars when they are using fuel. Second, humans add pollution to the environment through industrial activities and waste disposal. Nowadays, many countries are trying to decrease both waste disposal and CO2 emission.

Probably, the most well-known way to reduce negative effects of waste disposal is waste sorting. It means that the waste is sorted into a few categories to be recycled later. Switching to electric vehicles is one of the most promising ways to reduce CO2 emission.

Different types of pollution are interconnected. For example, marine pollution might be caused by direct discharge of industrial waste into the ocean. But pollutants could also be released from the atmosphere.

Overpopulation is another factor that causes pollution, as well as a number of other problems. Overpopulated cities tend to be the ones with the biggest ecological problems. Vehicles and people themselves add too much pollution for a relatively small area.

But how can we stop pollution? First of all, we should reconsider our approach to transportation in general. Public transport, private and corporate vehicles produce a lot of CO2 in our cities. Second, we should stop being careless about our garbage disposal. Third, we need to realize that not only the governments are responsible for the planet, but every single human as well. Every time when you are making a food or transport choice, you can make some difference. In conclusion, I would like to say that our planet is our home, and we must keep it safe and clean for the future generations.
Lions are big, strong animals that live in some parts of the world. They are often called ¬´kings of the jungle¬ª even though they don‚Äôt really live in jungles. Lions have a special look with their golden fur and big, furry manes around their necks. The males have these manes, and they use them to look impressive and protect their necks.

Lions usually live in groups called prides. A pride can have a few lionesses and one or a few males. Lionesses are great hunters and work together to catch food. Lions mostly eat meat, which means they are carnivores. They hunt animals like zebras, wildebeests, and sometimes even bigger ones.

Even though lions might seem lazy because they rest a lot, they are actually strong and fast when they need to be. They can run quickly to catch their prey. In the evening, lions become more active and start looking for food. Cubs, which are baby lions, are really cute and playful. They learn important skills through playing that will help them when they grow up.

In conclusion, lions are powerful animals that live in groups. They have beautiful fur and live in places like savannas, not jungles. Lions hunt together, with lionesses doing most of the hunting, and they eat meat. Cubs learn by playing and grow up to be strong lions.
